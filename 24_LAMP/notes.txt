Stuff I ran:

made account on site, added credits and put in card

in terminal:
typed: brew install doctl
then: doctl auth init --context myUsername
ok now pause and go to the control panel which is below all
the clicky things on the dashboard (like deploy a droplet, etc.), adn find API on the side 
and click it and hit general a token.
copy the token, save it somehwere.
now continue the init thingy with the token.

switch to the right user 
doctl auth list
doct auth switch

type in doctl auth list --context myUsername

Then type:
doctl compute ssh-key import TODO-KEY-NAME --public-key-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
(generate a key first if u don't have one)

Then follow the client instructions cuz they're easier and work

now ssh into 
root@ip_on_droplet
apt update
apt upgrade (y)

now install a webserver
apt install nginx (y)
systemctl status nginx (to see if it's running)

now open up new tab and paste ip in address field- it should say hello to nginx

now type cd /var/www
cd into the html folder to see the default html file

for flask:
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev
$ sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
$ sudo apt-get install python3-venv
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev 

apt install python-pip (also tried bc couldn't find flask?)

then continue to follow this?
https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/flask-app-on-digital-ocean.html

and the flask app now runs on a port!

and you can run it as normal? but some fancy stuff to connect it to html... see doct above

for activating venv: source p01venv/bin/activate

update!! all works but the database stuff doesn't...
